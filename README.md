# AI Operator

A simple voice bot that uses Pipecat and OpenAI's real-time voice API to create an interactive AI operator with true end-to-end streaming for natural conversation flow.

## Features

- Real-time voice interaction with OpenAI's voice API
- Continuous audio streaming from browser to server
- Real-time transcription of audio chunks
- Streaming responses from the AI model
- Immediate text-to-speech conversion and playback
- Low latency throughout the entire pipeline
- Proper WebM audio format handling

## Get started

```python
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp env.example .env # and add your credentials
```

## Run the bot

```bash
python bot.py
```

## Run the HTTP server

This will host the static web client:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then, visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to start a session.

## How It Works

1. The application uses Pipecat's `WebsocketServerTransport` to communicate with a web client
2. Audio is continuously streamed from the browser to the server
3. The server processes the audio in real-time using OpenAI's Whisper API
4. Responses are generated by OpenAI's GPT models
5. Text-to-speech conversion happens immediately using OpenAI's TTS API
6. Audio is streamed back to the client for playback

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4o model)
- Deepgram API key (for speech-to-text)
- Cartesia API key (for text-to-speech)
- Microphone and speakers
- Modern web browser with WebSocket support
